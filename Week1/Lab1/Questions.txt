Where is the assertEquals method defined? What does it do? Can we use assertEquals for more than just int types? (Hint: Consult the API for JUnit)
	The assertEquals method is defined inside the test methods. It asserts that two objects are equal. The parameters are (Object expected, Object actual). I believe so, because the parameters it checks are objects, which can be more than just an int.

Briefly describe what each of the three tests is checking.
	All three of these tests are comparing an expected value, with the value at DiffUtil.findSmallestDiff(<array goes here>).

Why is our unimplemented findSmallestDiff method passing one of the tests?
Because in the findSmallestDiff method, if the length of the array is less than 2, then it returns -1. And arr1 fits that criteria. 

Why are we failing the third test? How should our method be modified to correct this?
The third one is failing because we are subtracting numbers, so to modify it, we need Math.abs to get the absolute value.

What is the appropriate call to assertEquals for your new test (test 4)?
 @Test
    public void elementsAlreadySortedByOne(){
        assertEquals(1, DiffUtil.findSmallestDiff(arr4));
    }

Provide one more test (test 5) for the findSmallestDiff method. Briefly describe your test and write the call to assertEquals here.

I wanted to test a small array that had much larger numbers than the previous tests. I made sure to have a number in the thousands and the ten thousands.

    @Test
    public void elementsLargeDifferences(){
        assertEquals(1498, DiffUtil.findSmallestDiff(arr5));
    }
arr5 = new int[] {2, 10000, 4000, 1500};

Briefly describe your unit tests for Assignment 1.
emptyArray() - checks for an empty array input and expects a -1.
allArrayElementsEqual() - checks that all elements in the array are the same or equal, it expects a 0.
smallRandomArrayElements() - tests random, unsorted values in the array. Expects a 4.
elementsAlreadySortedByOne() - tests when an entire array is incremented by one, expects a 1.
elementsLargeDifferences() - tests elements that are large in size and large in difference, expects 1498.
