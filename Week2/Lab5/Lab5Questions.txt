What activities did you do as the driver? What activities did you do as the navigator?
	 I was the driver on the first method, which was findMedian with the comparable and took in an array. I was navigator for the second method. For the tests, we switched back and forth pretty frequently.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of serving in each role?
	It is kind of scary to have someone looking at your screen and telling you what to do. It also exposes how much terminology you actually don't know.

How often did you and your partner switch roles? Did you switch often enough?
	We switched roles frequently. Especially when writing tests.

Which is your preferred role and why?
	Navigator because it's good practice with terminology and explaining how to code something instead of just doing it.

Explain why this is a BAD test case for your method: assertEquals("bird", MedianSolver.median(new String[]{"bird", "cat", "dog", "ant"}))
	First, it's missing a semi-colon. You would also want to add more to the array to find a true median, when it is only four items, the second item is the median, which isn't a true median. It also only works alphabetically, but if someone wanted these sorted by number of letters, it would be off.
	
Explain how you could change the test to make it "valid" and explain how you could change the specification so that this is considered a "good" test.
	Add more to the array. Create another part of the test that organizes the words by number of letters.
